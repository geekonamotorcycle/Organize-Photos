# Organize-Photos
A script that will enumerate and organize photos based on Creation Date or Last Modified Date.

If you want to run the script you only need to download Organize-Photos.ps1 and run it. 

1. Dump all your photos into a single folder. 
2. start the script.
3. Set options 1-4.
4. Run option 5! This will dump a file called test.csv into the same folder the script is being run from.
    Make sure you review that files, it will give you a better idea about whether you really should organize by creation date or modified 
    date.
5. Run the script with option 6. If you see an error message, figure it out on your own, its not too hard. I may be available to answer 
    questions, but don't count on that.

   files.
